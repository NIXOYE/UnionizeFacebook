# Unionize Facebook
If Facebook employees stand with Black Lives Matter they will Unionize. It is clear Facebook doesn't care about the opinion of it's employees and without a Union they will not have enough leverage to make true change.

Facebook employees have been coming out to condemn Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook's Actions regarding incitement of violence by the President of the United States against peaceful protestors demanding equal justice. While Facebook employees have been saying they stand with us and have been donating money to causes this feels much more like a way to absolve themselves of guilt than to truly fight for change. 

Y'all work at one of the richest and most powerful companies in the world. Y'all are some of the smartest people in the world. Yet all you want to do is donate some money, change your avatars and tweet wise words. Facebook itself had evidence it was sowing division in our country with their algorithms[1] Facebook conducted experiments on its users to test if they can change their emotions [2] and possibly worst of all after a huge security breach [3] it became clear Facebook allowed people to target specific groups of people based on their race, religion, or party affiliation to show them different ads that would influence them to vote for a particular candidate or not vote at all even if it uses lies to manipulate them [4]. 

Many employees at Facebook have voiced their concerns with these actions in seperate occasions but their complaints have obviously fallen on deaf ears. Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook as a whole has proven they will not listen to their employees which leaves them the only option. To unionize and demand change collectively. Walking out for a few days isn't enough. Voicing your contempt is not enough. Changing your avatar is NOT enough. We need ACTION and we need it NOW.

Black Lives Matter is not just three words. It is not an oppurtunity for y'all to pretend to stand with us. It is not a trend. It is not an aestethic. It is not a fucking Public Relations campaign. At the very least it is an oppurtunity to enact true change even in that face of adversity and PROVE y'all care about us. Please, do what's right. Unionize.
